This mod gives Syndikat some extra equipment for use in mission-making.

The Western Sahara Creator DLC and Arma 3: Aegis are optionally supported,
and some content will only appear when one or both of those are loaded.

Credit goes to Arma 3 Aegis, from which I used the textures for the
Mora, Gorgon and Zamak to create the textures in this mod.
