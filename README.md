This mod gives Syndikat some extra equipment for use in mission-making.

The Western Sahara Creator DLC and Arma 3: Aegis are optionally supported,
and some content will only appear when one or both of those are loaded.

## Credits
- Arma 3 Aegis, from which I used the textures for the Mora, Gorgon and
  Zamak as the basis for some textures in this mod.
- Ample Camo Pack, from which I used the textures from the 6 Color Desert
  PBO to create a number of items.
